# 🏛️ Neural Nexus — Virtual 3D Museum

An interactive browser-based 3D museum built using **A-Frame (WebXR)**.  
Visitors can walk inside a virtual exhibition hall, explore artworks, and experience cinematic lighting with atmospheric depth — directly in the browser.

No installation. No game engine. Runs entirely on the web.
